        <h2><u>Ingredients</u></h2>
        <h3>For the pork meatballs:</h3>

            <li>1 1/2 lb ground pork</li>
            <li>1/4 C sugar</li>
            <li>4 1/2 tbsp water, divided</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tbsp minced garlic</li>
            <li>1/4 C minced shallots</li>
            <li>2-3 lemongrass stalks, white part only, finely minced</li>
            <li>2 tbsp fish sauce</li>
            <li>2 tsp oyster sauce</li>
            <li>black pepper tt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><u>For the dipping sauce:</u></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 C lime juice</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 C water</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tbsp fish sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp minced garlic</li>
            <li>thinly sliced carrots and/or green papaya</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><u>Instructions:</u></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small saucepan, add 1/4 cup of sugar and 3 tablespoons of water. Bring to a boil. Lower the heat to medium, continue to simmer. You will see a lot of bubbles on the surface. The mixture will then turn from clear to yellow, and get darker as you simmer it. Reduce the heat if needed. Keep watching closely, until it has a slightly dark caramel color, turn off the heat and carefully add 1 1/2 tablespoons of water. Swirl the saucepan to combine and remove it from the stove. Set aside.</li>
            <br>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, add the ground pork, caramel sauce and all other ingredients for the pork meatballs. Mix for a couple of minutes to combine thoroughly. Set aside for 10-15 minutes or marinate in the refrigerator for 1-2 hours for tastier results.</li>
            <br>
            <li>To make the dipping sauce, whisk together lime juice, sugar, water, and fish sauce in a bowl. Adjust to taste. Add garlic, and add thinly sliced carrots and green papaya if using. Set aside.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Prepare vermicelli noodles according to package instructions. Prepare lettuce and fresh herbs.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Heat the grill pan (or preheat gas grill/charcoal grill if thatâ€™s what you use to cook the meatballs). Shape the marinated pork into small meatballs. Once the pan is hot, grill them in a single layer until fully cooked.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Put the grilled meatballs in the the dipping sauce, serve immediately with noodles, lettuce and herbs.</li>
        </ol>
